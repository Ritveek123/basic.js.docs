    <h2>1. creating a canvas</h2>
    <p>To create a canvas we have a function called createCanvas() which takes 4 parameters class, width, height, display.</p>
    <p>Class is a name for the canvas from which we can acces on javascript or in css. Then comes width and height as the </p>
    <p>name suggests it is used to set width and height of the canvas lastly we have display it is used to put the canvas </p>
    <p>on a div or span for now you can just set it to body which is a build in variable in basic.js.</p>
    <h2>2. changing the color of canvas</h2>
    <p>To change the color of the canvas we have a function called setBackground() which takes 2 parameters name and </p>
    <p>the color. here is a sample code</p>
    <p>let canvas = createCanvas("canvas", 400, 400, body);</p>
    <p>setBackground(canvas, "gray");</p>
    <h2>3. creating a main gameloop</h2>
    <p>To create a game loop first we have to create a function then we have a function called loop() which take one</p>
    <p>parameter, the name of the function we have just created.</p>
    <p>the whole code for getting started: </p>
    <p>let canvas = createCanvas("canvas", 400, 400, body);</p>
    <p>function update(){</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>setBackground(canvas, "gray");</p>
    <p>loop(update);</p>

    <h2>1. creating a box</h2>
    <p>To create a box we have a function called createSquare() which takes 7 parameters name, w, h, x, y, display, color.</p>
    <p>we know the the use of name and display. w is for width, h is for height, x is for x position, y is for y position</p>
    <p>and lastly color is to set color for box and here is the code: </p>
    <p>let box = createSquare("box", 40, 40, 20, 90, canvas, "red");</p>
    <h2>2. loading a image and displaying it to the canvas</h2>
    <p>Displaying square isn't fun so we should display some images, To do that we have a function called loadImage()</p>
    <p> which takes 7 parameters name, img, x, y, w, h, display. I am not going to explain name, x, y, w, h, display. </p>
    <p>img is the path of the image that you want. here is the code</p>
    <p>let img = loadImage(".img", "test.png", 80, 40, 40, 40, canvas);</p>
    <h2>3. replacing the image</h2>
    <p>To replace the image we have a function called replaceImage() which takes 2 parameters name, image. But here the name</p>
    <p>is the name of the image you loaded and image is the path of the image you want to replace with. here is the code: </p>
    <p>replaceImage(img, "test(1).png")</p>
    <p>the whole code till now:</p>
    <p>let canvas = createCanvas("canvas", 400, 400, body);</p>
    <p>let box = createSquare("box", 40, 40, 20, 90, canvas, "red");</p>
    <p>let img = loadImage(".img", "test.png", 80, 40, 40, 40, canvas);</p>
    <p>replaceImage(img, "test(1).png")</p>
    <p>function update(){</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>setBackground(canvas, "gray");</p>
    <p>loop(update);</p>
